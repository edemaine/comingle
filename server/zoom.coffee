To use the Zoom Web Client SDK [https://github.com/zoom/sample-app-web],
you need to sign up for an API Key & Secret.  Go to the Zoom Marketplace
[https://marketplace.zoom.us/] and select "Create a JWT App".
See https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/sdk/native-sdks/web/getting-started/integrate

Then add the API Key & Secret into `settings.json` at the root of this
repository.  It should look something like this:

{
  "zoom": {
    "apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "apiSecret": "YOUR_API_SECRET"
  }
}

DO NOT commit your changes to this file into Git; the secret needs to
STAY SECRET.  To ensure Git doesn't accidentally commit your changes, use

    git update-index --assume-unchanged settings.json

If you're deploying via mup, it should pick up these keys.
If you're developing locally, use

    meteor --settings settings.json
